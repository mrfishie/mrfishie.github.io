    <h2>ABOUT</h2>

    <div>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Tom, also known as cpdt and previously mrfishie. I come from,
            and currently live in, the sunny eastern coast of Australia. From an
            early age I've been interested in computers, software, and design.
            I'm also interested in lighting design and tech,
            photography/videography, rendering, functional languages &amp;
            language design, and open-source.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm experienced in designing developing software and websites built
            with modern web technologies, NodeJS, and PHP. I'm also experienced
            in building native applications with C# and WPF, as well as C++
            and OpenGL. I've also experimented with functional-paradigm
            languages such as Haskell and Scala, and am interested in functional
            language design.
        </p>
        <p>
            I sometimes publish different libraries and projects on my
            <a href="https://github.com/cpdt/" target="_blank">Github account</a>
            (previously on <a href="https://github.com/mrfishie/" target="_blank">my old account</a>),
            however am mostly inactive there due to <a href="demoscene.html">my
            demoscene involvement</a>.
