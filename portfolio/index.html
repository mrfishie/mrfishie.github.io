                This is the homepage for MONAD,
                <a href="../demoscene.html">my demogroup</a>. It is developed
                in modern HTML and CSS, with some custom Javascript for a center
                carousel.

                64 intros (see
                <a href="../demoscene.html">my writeup on the demoscene</a>),
                have to include a software synthesizer to create music, as it's
                not possible to embed a full song saved as an mp3 or similar in
                an executable and have it come in at less than 64kib in size.
            </p>
            <p>
                Omeda, developed in mid-2017, is MONAD's synthesizer. It comes
                in three components: the editor, the VSTi, and the replayer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The editor is a tool, written in C# with WPF, that allows
                editing a node graph. This node graph is then converted to a flat
                format and sent to the VSTi, written in mixed-mode C++, which
                exists in a DAW, to tell it  how to synthesize sounds. When
                exporting a demo, the replayer is embedded in the demo
                executable file along with the song and instrument data. It then
                plays the song in realtime.

            <p>
                In order to create 64k intros (see
                <a href="../demoscene.html">my writeup on the demoscene</a>),
                it is beneficial to have a 'tool' that allows you to quickly
                iterate on the intro, and do things like manage animations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mostly completed in mid-2017, Functor is MONAD's graphical
                tool. While the UI, created with WPF, is relatively simple,
                Functor is actually a very powerful piece of software -
                it features a custom declarative language (parsed with a custom
                recursive descent parser) called PDL, used to declare graphic
                pipelines
                and shader interaction, and also integrates with a tracker for
                animating properties. Additionally, Functor has an export
                feature which compiles the project to an executable, and
                optionally compresses it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Functor itself is written in C# 7 and WPF, while the backend
                'player' is written in C++ with OpenGL.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I first learnt about the demoscene in late 2016, I knew
                absolutely nothing about realtime rendering. Throughout the
                development of Functor, I have learnt about OpenGL, shaders,
                how the graphics card works, how post-processing works,
                rendering techniques, and more - as a result, it has been a very
                valuable experience.

            <h3><a href="mysterious-mister-e.html">THE MYSTERIOUS MISTER E</a></h3>
            <p>
                Originally created for a school IT assignment, The Mysterious
                Mister E is a short film about censorship and oppressive
                governments. It follows the story of Mister E, an enigmatic
                vigilante courier.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the film, I largely focused on storyline and cinematics
                (although due to limited time I was unable to polish these
                completely). I tried to create a storyline which was open
                to interpretation and made the watcher think, while also being
                immersive and interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                After submitting the assignment, I also submitted the short film
                to Screen It!, an annual high-school film competition run by
                the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACME). I was humbled
                to win the national senior animation category.
            </p>
            <p>
                The short film, with both real-time and animated components, was
                quite ambitious. Throughout the project, I learnt many advanced
                concepts in Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere, the former
                of which was used for most animation. Additionally, the project
                taught me many important things about cinematography and
                story-telling, which I am now using in the demoscene.

                In mid-2016, Microsoft announced the Windows Subsystem for
                Linux, a project which aimed to allow running Linux-compatible
                software on Windows without a virtual machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Very early on, I created a small utility for WSL, which allowed
                'linking' a command on Windows to one on Linux (that is, running
                the command on Windows actually runs it on Linux). This became
                <a href="https://github.com/cpdt/slinky" target="_blank">Slinky</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Slinky is a small utility written in Bash and Batch, and so far
                has gotten some attention from people in CODE Network and on
                Hacker News (although I have not been particularly vigilante
                about advertising it). Nowadays it is largely unmaintained, but
                that is primarily because it works, and works well.

            <p>
                CODE Network is a large community of developers primarily in
                Brisbane. Mid-2016, they had a challenge to create a new site
                for them.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of this challenge, I designed and created
                <a href="https://github.com/cpdt/codenetwork" target="_blank">a site</a>
                using
                modern responsive HTML and CSS, and minimalistic degradable
                Javascript. Additionally, I created a backend written in NodeJS,
                using the lightweight backend engine I had developed for this
                project called
                <a href="https://github.com/cpdt/trea" target="_blank">trea</a>,
                and MongoDB.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the CODE Network competition didn't end up happening (due
                to administration issues), this project was beneficial as it
                allowed me to update my skills in full-stack development (many
                of the large projects I had done previously used PHP or a
                bloated web framework such as Angular and SailsJS). Whenever
                designing websites, I always try to minimize bloat and ensure
                that the site loads fast and runs well (typically, this means
                reducing Javascript and not using big libraries like React when
                they're not needed) - you can do a lot with just HTML and CSS.

                <a href="https://github.com/toxic-spanner" target="_blank">Toxic Spanner</a>
                was a project to create a programming language
                that could be 'compiled' to circuitry in the game Minecraft,
                called 'redstone'. This was comprised of a macro language called
                MCA, a compiler, and a library and framework to create complex
                systems in the language.
            </p>
            <p>
                The compiler was developed in NodeJS, and used
                <a href="https://zaa.ch/jison/" target="_blank">JISON</a> for
                parsing. It would then emit output in a format called 'MCIL',
                which was converted to Minecraft blocks by a separate program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the project was discontinued before the library
                or framework were completed, largely due to not having time
                due to other commitments. Despite this, the project (especially
                the compiler) were a good learning experience, and many of the
                techniques learnt were beneficial to future projects, such as
                Functor.

                The Problem was a bug tracker project created by myself and two

                hosted, it allowed administrators to create bug sections and

                and upvote bugs.

            <p>
                The site, which was primarily designed by myself, was inspired
                by Google's Material design specification, and utilized various
                modern HTML/CSS features. On the backend, the site was written
                in PHP, using my LimePHP framework (which was initially
                developed for Mozzo). Various performance enhancements were made
                to LimePHP, allowing The Problem to be very fast and lightweight.

            <p>
                In late 2015, while working on a potential game concept, I
                created a Javascript 2D canvas rendering library called Larwan.
                The goal was to create a system that was easy to use and
                understand, while also being fast and allowing complex scenes to
                be displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The library used modern (at the time) Javascript features to
                create a tree-based rendering system that would batch
                scene modifications and only re-render parts of the canvas that
                had changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                After some progress on the library, I ended up being too busy
                with schoolwork to continue development and had to stop. Despite
                this, developing this library helped me learn many of the
                concepts in rendering.

            <p>
                In early 2015 I created a custom server written in NodeJS for
                <a href="http://artemis.eochu.com/" target="_blank">Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator</a>,
                with the purpose of allowing the Artemis community to customize
                and build new features for the game, while also being suitable
                for the MMO community (which the official game server was not).
            </p>
            <p>
                This project involved reverse-engineering the Artemis server
                protocol and behaviour. Through the efforts of this project and
                others (<a href="https://github.com/IvanSanchez/artemis-glitter" target="_blank">artemis-glitter</a>
                and <a href="https://github.com/rjwut/ArtClientLib" target="_blank">ArtClientLib</a>,
                the latter of which had already reverse-engineered large parts
                of the protocol),
                the <a href="https://github.com/artemis-nerds" target="_blank">Artemis Nerds</a>
                group was formed, with the primary goal of comprehensively
                documenting many of the games protocols.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the custom Artemis server is now discontinued, and Artemis
                Nerds is rather inactive, throughout this project I learnt
                about the principles of reverse-engineering, game servers,
                working with a remote team, and how to compromise on team
                decisions.

            <p>
                Potential was a game I created and developed for a school IT
                assignment. The assignment, which put an emphasis on
                technology rather than enjoyability, challenged us to create
                a game that would teach the player a skill. The skill I chose?
                Hand-eye coordination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game was developed in Javascript, and rendered with the
                Canvas API. In order to accomplish this, I created a
                minimalistic game engine which used a component-based
                architecture for rendering, and supported complex animations
                and events. This was utilized in 'Music' mode, where the game
                background and procedural world would change to the music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, as the game contained copyrighted music from a
                similar game called VVVVVV, I am unable to release it online.
                The source code is <a href="https://github.com/mrfishie/potential" target="_blank">available on Github</a>, however.
            </p>
            <p>
                This game was one of the projects that initially got me
                interested in game development, particularly rendering. Many
                of the techniques I learned here made their way into Larwan, my
                tree-based rendering engine, and then the demoscene.

            <p>
                Falling Star was one of my first forays into animation and
                video production. It was a short film, created in Adobe Flash,
                for a school media assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project taught me various things about animating and
                rendering, including the basics of keyframing, boning and dirty
                rendering.

            <h3>MOZZO</h3>
            <p>
                Mozzo was an ambitious project to develop a social network
                aggregator, capable of bringing in data from many different
                social networks and displaying them together. The project was
                created by a friend and I, however most of the work on the site
                was done by myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site's frontend was written in modern responsive HTML/CSS,
                and the backend in PHP. For this project I took some of the
                framework code I had developed for Playzone and turned it into
                a proper PHP framework, called LimePHP. This framework provided
                many features such as templating, routing, database handling,
                package managing, and lazy-loaded modules. It was later
                improved for, and used by, The Problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mozzo was my third entry to the Young ICT Explorers competition,
                submitted to the much more competitive year 10-12 category.
                Unfortunately it did not place, likely due to it's incompletion
                at competition time (we had only had time to properly implement
                and test one social network, Facebook).
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally the plan was to continue mozzo and attempt to get it
                out to the world, however both members of our team became too
                busy with school to continue work on it.

            <h3>GLASS</h3>
            <p>
                A friend and I started working on Glass, a search engine written
                in PHP, in early 2014. Glass was primarily created as a learning
                experience for us, and was designed to be slick and easy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to develop Glass, I created a custom web crawler
                written in PHP. This involved learning about crawling and
                scraping fundamentals. Additionally, I implemented various
                algorithms for searching, including PageRank and some of my own.
                Most of the user interface was developed by my friend, and the
                backend by myself.

            <p>
                Playzone was my second entry to the Young ICT Explorers
                competition, a Brisbane-based ICT competition for high-schoolers
                run by SAP. It was an ambitious social network focused around
                online Flash games. It offered user-submittable games,
                customizable profiles, and a powerful admin system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Playzone backend was written in PHP5 with MySQL as the
                database, with a modern and responsive HTML/CSS/Javascript
                frontend. The site was completely designed and programmed by
                myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the project I developed a basic PHP framework, which
                would later become LimePHP (see mozzo and The Problem). This
                project taught me many of the basics and principles in designing
                web frameworks, administration and permission systems, and
                social networks. Playzone achieved second place in the year
                8-9 category of YICTE.

            <p>
                Cubepals, a game created for an IT assignment in mid-2013,
                was my first foray into game development. The assignment's
                task was to create a game that young children could play
                in order to learn some skill - in this case, puzzle and
                problem solving. The premise of the game was simple - get
                all of the cubes onto the buttons of their respective
                colours. This was made more complicated by walls that
                couldn't be dragged through, walls that would only open when
                a cube was on a button, and trampolines that would make a
                cube jump.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game was developed in Adobe Flash, using Actionscript 3.
                Later in the year, I also started working on a version for
                the Windows RT platform (built with HTML/CSS/Javascript),
                however lost interest and became busy with other projects.

            <p>
                ReEarth was a project completed by a friend and I for a school
                SOSE assignment in late 2012. The site provided information on
                renewable energies such as solar and biogas, and also provided
                a couple of learning objects for interactive learning of the
                subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site was primarily written in PHP, with a custom simple CMS
                that would pull info from text files. The learning objects were
                created in Adobe Flash. This project taught me a lot about
                designing CMS's and full-stack websites with PHP, as well as
                the basics of creating content in Flash, both of which were
                beneficial to me in future projects.

            <h3>WORDWIKI</h3>
            <p>
                Wordwiki was my first ever entry to the Young ICT Explorers
                competition, a Brisbane-based ICT competition for high-schoolers
                run by SAP. It was a simple wiki-like dictionary, where users
                where able to search for and add words or definitions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site was written in modern HTML and Javascript with jQuery,
                along with a PHP/MySQL backend. This was my first main
                introduction to full-stack web development, and I continued
                along that path for many years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project achieved 2nd place in the year 8-9 category at
                YICTE, and development was stopped soon after due to interests
                in different projects. Unfortunately I no longer have the source
                code for it.

            <p>
                In order to fill a hole I saw in simple software to backup
                USBs, I created Speedsync in early 2012. This was a simple
                program written in C# and WinForms that allowed two locations
                to be synced, a USB to be automatically synced when plugged
                in, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The software reached a suitable feature and stability level
                later that year, and so development was stopped. While I
                personally do not still use Speedsync, I know of at least one
                friend who used it up until recently.
